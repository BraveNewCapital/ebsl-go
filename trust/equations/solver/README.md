Overview
--------

This file provides the implementation of the Solver type, which is used to solve equations in the Evidence Based Subjective Logic framework.

The Solver type is responsible for solving the equations represented as a system of linear equations, and provides a set of methods for setting up and solving these equations. The equations are used to calculate the probability of various events given the available evidence.

Types
-----

### Solver

The `Solver` type represents an object that can solve equations in the Evidential Bayesian Soft Logic framework.

#### Fields

*   `Matrix` - A matrix that represents the system of linear equations.
*   `Vector` - A vector that represents the right-hand side of the system of linear equations.

#### Methods

##### `NewSolver() *Solver`

Creates a new instance of the `Solver` type.

##### `AddEquation(variables []uint64, coefficients []float64, constant float64) error`

Adds an equation to the system of linear equations.

*   `variables` - A slice of variable IDs that represent the variables in the equation.
*   `coefficients` - A slice of coefficients that correspond to each variable in the equation.
*   `constant` - The constant value on the right-hand side of the equation.

##### `Solve() ([]float64, error)`

Solves the system of linear equations and returns a slice of values that correspond to the probabilities of the events represented by the variables.

Usage
-----

Here is an example usage of the `Solver` type:

goCopy code

`solver := NewSolver()  // Add equations to the solver err := solver.AddEquation([]uint64{1, 2}, []float64{1.0, 1.0}, 0.5) if err != nil {     panic(err) }  // Solve the system of linear equations probabilities, err := solver.Solve() if err != nil {     panic(err) }  // Print the resulting probabilities fmt.Println(probabilities)`

In this example, we create a new `Solver` instance, add an equation to it, solve the system of linear equations, and print the resulting probabilities.
