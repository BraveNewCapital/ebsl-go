==============

This file contains the implementation of the Equations module, which provides functions for calculating different types of opinions based on evidence. It contains several equations used in the calculation of opinions, such as distance-based and cumulative.

Overview
--------

The module provides a set of functions for calculating opinions based on evidence. It implements different equations, including distance-based and cumulative, which can be used to calculate the credibility of evidence.

Functions
---------

The following functions are available in this module:

### `CumulativeBelief(c uint64, w []float64) float64`

This function calculates the Cumulative Belief based on the provided weights and credibility factor `c`. The function takes an array of float64 values representing the weights of the evidence and returns a float64 value representing the calculated Cumulative Belief.

### `CumulativeDisbelief(c uint64, w []float64) float64`

This function calculates the Cumulative Disbelief based on the provided weights and credibility factor `c`. The function takes an array of float64 values representing the weights of the evidence and returns a float64 value representing the calculated Cumulative Disbelief.

### `CumulativeUncertainty(c uint64, w []float64) float64`

This function calculates the Cumulative Uncertainty based on the provided weights and credibility factor `c`. The function takes an array of float64 values representing the weights of the evidence and returns a float64 value representing the calculated Cumulative Uncertainty.

### `DistanceBelief(c uint64, w []float64, d []float64) float64`

This function calculates the Distance Belief based on the provided weights, distances, and credibility factor `c`. The function takes two arrays of float64 values representing the weights and distances of the evidence, respectively, and returns a float64 value representing the calculated Distance Belief.

### `DistanceDisbelief(c uint64, w []float64, d []float64) float64`

This function calculates the Distance Disbelief based on the provided weights, distances, and credibility factor `c`. The function takes two arrays of float64 values representing the weights and distances of the evidence, respectively, and returns a float64 value representing the calculated Distance Disbelief.

### `DistanceUncertainty(c uint64, w []float64, d []float64) float64`

This function calculates the Distance Uncertainty based on the provided weights, distances, and credibility factor `c`. The function takes two arrays of float64 values representing the weights and distances of the evidence, respectively, and returns a float64 value representing the calculated Distance Uncertainty.

### `FromEvidence(c uint64, ev Type) Type`

This function converts the given evidence `ev` to an opinion using the provided credibility factor `c`. The function returns an instance of the `Type` struct representing the calculated opinion.

### `FromOpinions(opinions []Type) Type`

This function calculates the opinion based on the given array of opinions `opinions`. The function takes an array of `Type` instances representing the opinions and returns an instance of the `Type` struct representing the calculated opinion.

Conclusion
----------

The Equations module provides a set of functions for calculating different types of opinions based on evidence. It implements different equations, including distance-based and cumulative, which can be used to calculate the credibility of evidence.
